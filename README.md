## Overview

First **working** attempt at a _Github Actions_ workflow for publishing with pnpm to GitHub Packages and the npmjs registry, with _provenance_ and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

In the next step, I will leverage the automation built into GitHub Actions to publish release notes.

I still need to write a CI workflow, but what I've learned so far has been worth it.
